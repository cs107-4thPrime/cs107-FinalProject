**Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement**
As we reflect on the potential use cases and applications of our software package, it is important to consider the downstream consequences, be they intended or not, of our product.  Our automatic differentiation package is designed to enable fast, user-friendly, and accurate derivative computations. Potential applications of this technology are many, ranging from high-performance scientific computing, to research, to commercial deployment in neural network powered prediction systems. With this release we would like to add some words of caution and advice. One of the risks associated with this technology is aiding the facilitation of ill-willed or malicious actors. For example, groups or individuals interested in propagating fake news could deploy this package to efficiently and accurately adapt their algorithm to maximize the reach of their ideology. Like many technologies, automatic differentiation may be neutral but its users are not and therefore we must acknowledge the uncertainties and risks associated with releasing this technology to the world. 

Our software promotes inclusivity and belonging in the broader scientific and industrial community by being accessible to users from all walks of life. Easily accessible and deployable due to its detailed documentation and user-friendly interface our package is agnostic to a user’s previous background or technical capability. However, it is important that we acknowledge the unseen barriers that may impact a user’s experience. For example, users who speak English as a second language may find some of our API and naming conventions unintuitive. Additionally, users without access to high-performance computing hardware may find it challenging to scale this technology to their desired level. As we work to advance our technology, we do so with an orientation toward broadening our user-base and making the power of automatic differentiation available to an even larger cross-section of the global community.

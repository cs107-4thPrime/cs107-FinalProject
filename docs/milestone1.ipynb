    "The ability to compute rates is fundamental to nearly all areas of scientific understanding ranging from basic science to machine learning. In order to gain insights into the inner workings of a system, we must be able to understand how that system changes over time, and how different perturbations affect those changes. Oftentimes we can model the phenomena underlying a system through equations, such as those that describe temperature, motion, and force, to name a few. However, many real-world phenomena are too complex to be reduced to simple mathematical equations. Not only are these equations complex, but it can be very onerous to compute their derivatives by hand, which is necessary for a number of different applications (described below). While numerical differentiation techniques like the method of finite differences offers an alternative to symbolic differentiation for functions whose derviative cannot be computed analytically, the discretization of the problem introduces round-off errors that can accumulate to give an ultimate answer that is not accurate enough for the scientific applications at hand. Our software provides a streamlined, automated computational tool to quickly calculate the derivatives of functions by composing elementary mathematical operations. Automatic differentiation avoids the expression swell of symbolic differentiation and the imprecision of numerical differentiation. The overarching motivation of automatic differentiation is to compute the rate of change for a function of arbitrary complexity through the use of point values and elementary derivatives. AD allows us to get a numerical value of a function's derivative without approximation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations that describe these sorts of situations are often complex and messy to work with, but there are a number of ways we can gain insight from them. If we want to understand not just the current state of a system but also how it changes over time, we need to take the derivative of these complex equations.  Moreover, oftentimes it is useful to model the local behavior of a system within an extremely small window. In such instances, we may find it helpful to use a derivative . Lastly, if we want to identify extreme cases, we will need to take a derivative to identify extrema or inflection points. Our automatic differentiation package allows us to accomplish all of this to the accuracy of machine precision. \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic differentiation** is a series of processes automated by a computer program to calculate the derivative of a given function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function consists of **elementary functions**, which are the building blocks of more complex functions. They are functions of a single variable (real or complex). Examples of such functions involve taking sums, products, polynomial, exponential, inverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition of derivatives is enabled by the **chain rule**. \n",
    "For a given function $h(u(t), v(t))$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dh}{dt}$=($\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial u}$)($\\frac{du}{dt}$)+($\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial v}$)($\\frac{dv}{dt}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "AD has two modes: the forward mode and the reverse mode. In this project milestone 1, we will apply **chain rule** in forward mode from inside to outside. The corresponding **graph structure of the forward mode** first calculates forward primal trace, forward tangent trace and passes of the independent variables. Then, it computes those of the dependent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function can be accomplished using **Dual Number**. **Dual Number** is similar to **Complex Number** ($z=x + iy$ where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part. $i^{2}=-1$). Dual Number can be expressed in the form of $z=a+b*epilson$ where a,b are real numbers, $epilson^{2}=0$ and $epilson!=0$. In the context of automatic differentiation, the real part of the dual number corresponds to the primal trace whereas the dual part corresponds to the tangent trace. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to apply **operator overloading** on the Dual Class. **Operator overloading** is the act of changing the behavior of an operator on its arguments. Depending on the exact argument the operator acts on, the operator may implement differently. Therefore, operator overloading is a form of polymorphism. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we have multiple variables, we can express the partial derivatives in the form of **Jacobian**. For a function $f(x)$ : $R^{m}$ -> $R^{n}$, the **Jacobian** is a n*m matrix consisted of the first derivatives of the mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Newton’s method** belongs to a class of algorithms which can be solved using AD. Newton’s method is a root-finding algorithm of a non-linear function f(x) to satisfy f(x)=0. An initial guess is taken first, then Newton’s method runs iteratively to find the root of the function. Convergence depends on good initial guesses and is not guaranteed. "

    "### Graph structure of calculations\n",
    "For the forward mode, the graph structure of the auto differentiation first calculates forward primal trace, forward tangent trace and passes of the independent variables. Then, it computes those of the dependent variables. \n",
    "For the reverse mode, the graph structure works backward from the outputs to the inputs. Since the last node has no children, the initial value of the adjoint of the last node will be 1. Then the second to last node’s adjoint is evaluated iteratively until reaching the adjoint of the last node in reverse order.\n",
